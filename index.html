<p>A collection of svg emoticons that can be used in IM chats and so on. </p>

<p>Many users like me love collecting interesting (or just <em>moe</em>) emoticons so they can use
it over chats. However, many of those chats are quite low-quality (as in image quality), 
and doing the fork-and-recompress process can make a huge decrease on the image qualities.</p>

<p>This repository mainly collect vectorized versions of emoticons, redrawn mainly by me.</p>

<p>Why svg?</p>

<ul>
<li>SVG is a great open format for vector images.</li>
<li>SVG consists of XML code, and editing it creates a lot of diff â€” that is absolutely the
best way to write large quantities of code. (Just Kidding.)</li>
</ul>

<a id="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use</h2>

<p>Sometimes <a href="https://github.com/Arthur2e5/svg-emoticons/releases">Releases</a> contain some Bitmaps
or Optimized SVGs. Check them out. If you are looking for those Ingress images, just go there.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://github.com/Arthur2e5/svg-emoticons/archive/master.zip">Download Zip</a>
on the right side of the page to get a HEAD snapshot containing all the SVGs; or you can wander
around the tree and find the one you want to download.</p>

<p><strong>Ordinary users:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Download and install Inkscape(<a href="https://inkscape.org">https://inkscape.org</a>). If you are using Linux, try to check
it out in your distribution's software repository. </li>
<li>Considering creating a white rectangle as the background before exporting.</li>
<li>
<strong>File -&gt; Export as PNG.</strong> Choose the suitable file size for you.</li>
<li>If you are not happy with the file size of the 24-bit PNG, read 
<a href="http://www.equn.com/forum/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=38948">This thread (Chinese)</a> to get
instructions on optimizing the file size.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://pngquant.org/">pngquant</a> is the best choice for PNGs. It generates a PNG with max.
256 colors, and preserves full alpha transparency. </li>
<li>
<a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/">RIOT</a> is a nice
choise if you use Windows. Saving as 16- to 256-color, max-compressed PNG is recommended. 
Blending the image with a white background in RIOT can help you deal with some transparency
problems. </li>
<li>Using Adobe (R) Photoshop (R) or Paint.NET works better for images with transparency. The
decision is up to you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Webmasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are not worried about size or compatibility, just use the SVGs.</li>
<li>If you are facing old browsers, export it to bitmap just like what ordinary users do.</li>
<li>For better size or compatibility, try <strong>File -&gt; Save As -&gt; Optimized SVG</strong> in Inkscape.
Choose the options you want to use. (Actually to make files look prettier, I am already
optimizing the files in-repo, but anyway you might want more control over the files..)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="copying" class="anchor" href="#copying" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COPYING</h2>

<p>See the files' metadata for Copyright information. If there isn't one in the files, just assume
CC-BY 4.0 with the copyright holders being the contributors in the file history.</p>

<p>Since those emoticons are mainly used for IM chats, always claiming the author(s) may be impossible.
Here I reduce this limit so it works only on people who fork those SVG images.</p>

<h2>
<a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CONTRIBUTING</h2>

<p>Simply fork &amp; PR. Don't forget to add your copyright info to the Dublin Core metadata if you want to
have the info in the files.</p>

<p>You may want to optimize the SVGs before making a PR since it can help reduce some unnecessary 
digits and/or style attributes. Four significant digits, shoren color values, CSS2XML, Group
collapsing and creating for similar attributes, working around renderer bugs and removing/
shortening IDs should be suitable for most cases. For images with smooth nodes, consider
keeping editor data. Do NOT remove metadata or comments. Use tabs for indentation.</p>
