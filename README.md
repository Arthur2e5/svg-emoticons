svg-emoticons
=============

A collection of svg emoticons that can be used in IM chats and so on. 

Many users like me love collecting interesting (or just _moe_) emoticons so they can use
it over chats. However, many of those chats are quite low-quality (as in image quality), 
and doing the fork-and-recompress process can make a huge decrease on the image qualities.

This repository mainly collect vectorized versions of emoticons, redrawn mainly by me.

Why svg?
- SVG is a great open format for vector images.
- SVG consists of XML code, and editing it creates a lot of diff â€” that is absolutely the
  best way to write large quantities of code. (Just Kidding.)

How to use
----------

Sometimes [Releases](https://github.com/Arthur2e5/svg-emoticons/releases) contain some Bitmaps
or Optimized SVGs. Check them out. If you are looking for those Ingress images, just go there.

Use [Download Zip](https://github.com/Arthur2e5/svg-emoticons/archive/master.zip)
on the right side of the page to get a HEAD snapshot containing all the SVGs; or you can wander
around the tree and find the one you want to download.

**Ordinary users:** 
- Download and install Inkscape(https://inkscape.org). If you are using Linux, try to check
  it out in your distribution's software repository. 
- Considering creating a white rectangle as the background before exporting.
- **File -> Export as PNG.** Choose the suitable file size for you.
- If you are not happy with the file size of the 24-bit PNG, read 
  [This thread (Chinese)](https://www.equn.com/forum/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=38948) to get
  instructions on optimizing the file size.
  - [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/) is the best choice for PNGs. It generates a PNG with max.
    256 colors, and preserves full alpha transparency. 
  - [RIOT](http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/) is a nice
    choise if you use Windows. Saving as 16- to 256-color, max-compressed PNG is recommended. 
    Blending the image with a white background in RIOT can help you deal with some transparency
    problems. 
  - Using Adobe (R) Photoshop (R) or Paint.NET works better for images with transparency. The
    decision is up to you.

**Webmasters:**
- If you are not worried about size or compatibility, just use the SVGs.
- If you are facing old browsers, export it to bitmap just like what ordinary users do.
- For better size or compatibility, try **File -> Save As -> Optimized SVG** in Inkscape.
  Choose the options you want to use. (Actually to make files look prettier, I am already
  optimizing the files in-repo, but anyway you might want more control over the files..)

COPYING
-------

See the files' metadata for Copyright information. If there isn't one in the files, just assume
CC-BY 4.0 with the copyright holders being the contributors in the file history.

Since those emoticons are mainly used for IM chats, always claiming the author(s) may be impossible.
Here I reduce this limit so it works only on people who fork those SVG images.

CONTRIBUTING
------------

Simply fork & PR. Don't forget to add your copyright info to the Dublin Core metadata if you want to
have the info in the files.

You may want to optimize the SVGs before making a PR since it can help reduce some unnecessary 
digits and/or style attributes. Four significant digits, shoren color values, CSS2XML, Group
collapsing and creating for similar attributes, working around renderer bugs and removing/
shortening IDs should be suitable for most cases. For images with smooth nodes, consider
keeping editor data. Do NOT remove metadata or comments. Use tabs for indentation.
