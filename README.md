svg-emotocons
=============

A collection of svg emotocons that can be used in IM chats and so on. 

Many users like me love collecting interesting (or just _moe_) emotocons so they can use
it over chats. However, many of those chats are quite low-quality (as in image quality), 
and doing the fork-and-recompress process can make a huge decrease on the image qualities.

This repository mainly collect vectorized versions of emotocons, redrawn mainly by me.

Why svg?
- SVG is a great open format for vector images.
- SVG is XML code, and editing it creates a lot of diff â€” that is absolutely the best way to
  write huge quanlities of code. (Just Kidding.)
