Simple/
=======

This directory contains svg files that are considered _Simple_. These files 
have a relatively smaller file size and color count, and are simpler to fork.

There are already forks for those files provided in this repository. If you want 
to add more of them, feel free to do the _fork & PR_ work.

cat-*.svg
---------

These files share a base curve, found at `cat-basic.svg`. The eye position and the
big curve has been changed for better overall results. The closest-to-original one, 
though, is available as [commit d8d9353](http://git.io/NjKPRg). 

And there is actually something to say about `cat-ignorant.svg`. This file, actually
the one I first traced, doesn't share a lot of nodes/curves with the basic one. 
Later analytics on the original PNG image showed that it was actually the basic cat 
with mouth removed and two straight line bars added, but it just doesn't look nice
that way. The eyes' positions was kept when I moved the eyes in the basic svg, too.

### ears.svg

You know what? This is actually a replica of the _cat curve_. 

cookie-*.svg
-------------

This is another group of emotocons, and it also looks like `cat-*.svg`, at least in 
some ways. I don't know why all those simple emotocons I collect look like this.

It just look stood up, and it comes with a smaller bitmap size, and a red stroke color. 
_Cookie_ is a nickname of @amphineko.
