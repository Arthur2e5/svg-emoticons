  "body": "svg-emoticons\r\n=============\r\n\r\nA collection of svg emoticons that can be used in IM chats and so on. \r\n\r\nMany users like me love collecting interesting (or just _moe_) emoticons so they can use\r\nit over chats. However, many of those chats are quite low-quality (as in image quality), \r\nand doing the fork-and-recompress process can make a huge decrease on the image qualities.\r\n\r\nThis repository mainly collect vectorized versions of emoticons, redrawn mainly by me.\r\n\r\nWhy svg?\r\n- SVG is a great open format for vector images.\r\n- SVG consists of XML code, and editing it creates a lot of diff â€” that is absolutely the\r\n  best way to write large quantities of code. (Just Kidding.)\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSometimes [Releases](https://github.com/Arthur2e5/svg-emoticons/releases) contain some Bitmaps\r\nor Optimized SVGs. Check them out. If you are looking for those Ingress images, just go there.\r\n\r\nUse [Download Zip](https://github.com/Arthur2e5/svg-emoticons/archive/master.zip)\r\non the right side of the page to get a HEAD snapshot containing all the SVGs; or you can wander\r\naround the tree and find the one you want to download.\r\n\r\n**Ordinary users:** \r\n- Download and install Inkscape(https://inkscape.org). If you are using Linux, try to check\r\n  it out in your distribution's software repository. \r\n- Considering creating a white rectangle as the background before exporting.\r\n- **File -> Export as PNG.** Choose the suitable file size for you.\r\n- If you are not happy with the file size of the 24-bit PNG, read \r\n  [This thread (Chinese)](http://www.equn.com/forum/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=38948) to get\r\n  instructions on optimizing the file size.\r\n  - [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/) is the best choice for PNGs. It generates a PNG with max.\r\n    256 colors, and preserves full alpha transparency. \r\n  - [RIOT](http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/) is a nice\r\n    choise if you use Windows. Saving as 16- to 256-color, max-compressed PNG is recommended. \r\n    Blending the image with a white background in RIOT can help you deal with some transparency\r\n    problems. \r\n  - Using Adobe (R) Photoshop (R) or Paint.NET works better for images with transparency. The\r\n    decision is up to you.\r\n\r\n**Webmasters:**\r\n- If you are not worried about size or compatibility, just use the SVGs.\r\n- If you are facing old browsers, export it to bitmap just like what ordinary users do.\r\n- For better size or compatibility, try **File -> Save As -> Optimized SVG** in Inkscape.\r\n  Choose the options you want to use. (Actually to make files look prettier, I am already\r\n  optimizing the files in-repo, but anyway you might want more control over the files..)\r\n\r\nCOPYING\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSee the files' metadata for Copyright information. If there isn't one in the files, just assume\r\nCC-BY 4.0 with the copyright holders being the contributors in the file history.\r\n\r\nSince those emoticons are mainly used for IM chats, always claiming the author(s) may be impossible.\r\nHere I reduce this limit so it works only on people who fork those SVG images.\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTING\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSimply fork & PR. Don't forget to add your copyright info to the Dublin Core metadata if you want to\r\nhave the info in the files.\r\n\r\nYou may want to optimize the SVGs before making a PR since it can help reduce some unnecessary \r\ndigits and/or style attributes. Four significant digits, shoren color values, CSS2XML, Group\r\ncollapsing and creating for similar attributes, working around renderer bugs and removing/\r\nshortening IDs should be suitable for most cases. For images with smooth nodes, consider\r\nkeeping editor data. Do NOT remove metadata or comments. Use tabs for indentation.\r\n",
